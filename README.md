## Summary

#### Drawback: 

The drawback of the webpage is that user has to clear the content of the filter in order to get the full list once filtered information is displayed

#### Recommendation:

1.	An interactive refresh button could have helped user to un-filter any selection
2.	A dropdown option in the city, state or country list could have provided a better user experience
